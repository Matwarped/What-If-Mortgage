# Mortgage Repayment Planner

A simple **Svelte 5 web app** that helps you explore different repayment strategies for a mortgage (or any loan). You can:

- Enter your current balance and annual interest rate
- Set a baseline monthly repayment
- Compare it against two alternative repayment amounts
- Visualize the **loan balance over time** with a chart
- See a **comparison table** showing payoff time, interest, total repayment, and savings

This tool is currency agnostic â€” just input your values in your local currency.

## Features
- Built with **Svelte 5**
- Interactive loan payoff simulation
- Dynamic **line chart** using ApexCharts
- Side-by-side **comparison table**
- Configurable repayment amounts
- Shows **interest saved** and **months saved** vs baseline
